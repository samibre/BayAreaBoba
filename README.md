# Boba Shops in the Bay Area
by Samantha Do

This data set has the yelp rating and location of boba shops in the Bay Area in February 2018. I downloaded this set from this link: https://www.kaggle.com/vnxiclaire/bobabayarea. 

From the data visualization below, it appears that San Jose has the most boba shops in the Bay Area. This can be explained by the demographics because over a third of San Jose's population is Asian and boba is an Asian dessert drink. San Jose is also the largest municipality by land area and population.
